# Pokédex Web App 🎮✨

Welcome to my **Pokedex**!

This is a personal project I built with **React, TypeScript, and Vite**.
It connects to the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) so you can search for your favorite Pokemon.

You'll get their **sprite, type, stats, and abilities** - just like a real trainer's Pokedex! 🕹️🔎

## 🎯 Purpose

I created this project to practice **modern web development** while having fun with something I love: Pokemon.

It's not meant to be a full app, just a personal experiment to improve my coding skills.
